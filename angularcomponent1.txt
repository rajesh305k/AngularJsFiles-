first of all we need to create 
export class to use externally in another files 

export class ServerComponent {


}




we need to add component to it 

@Component()
export class ServerComponent {

}

but ts doesn't recognise it we need to import 


import  { Component } from '@angular/core';
@Component()
export class ServerComponent {

}


need to select properties in the component 
 


import {Component} from '@angular/core';//typescript will recognize component 
@Component({

selector:' ',//very unique id which no one should have 
template:[''],
templateUrl:'',//it consists of html file location('./server.component.html')
styleUrl:[''],
styling:['']

})

export class ServerComponent {

}


*******
we have success fully created ServerComponent.ts file 
but we need to add it in module file to work 

go to app.module.ts 

all import components 
//we need to import component 
@NgModule({

declarations: [AppComponent,ServerComponent
],
imports: [

]
providers:[],
bootstrap : [AppComponent]

})
export class AppModule{}

//declarations, imports , providers, bootstrap are the properties 
here ngmodule is an class declaration 

//bootstrap tells angular which component should this be aware of 
when application starts {recognize in index.html file }
// won't touch bootstrap array still we need to add it 
// so go to declarations and add new component "ServerComponent"
//angular does'nt scan everything we need to tell it explicitly 

this is all done typescript 
servercomponent is not known to typescript 
so we need to import
** import {ServerComponent } from'./server/server.component';
